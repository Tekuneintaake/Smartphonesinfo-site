        <h2>SMARTPHONE SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
        <p><span class="spec-title">What are smartphone specifications and why they matter</span></p>
        <p>Smartphone specifications are like the special features of a phone that tell you how good it is. They include things like the size of the screen, the power of the camera, how fast the phone works, and how much storage it has for apps and pictures. Just like a superhero has powers, smartphones have specifications that make them better at doing certain things.</p>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <p><span class="spec-title">Knowing smartphone specifications</span> is super important because it will help you figure out what phone suits your needs best. For example, if you love watching videos, you'd want a phone with a big screen and great sound. But if you just want to call your friends, you can go for a simpler phone that doesn't cost as much.</p>

        <h2>Brain (Processor)</h2>
        <p>Just like your brain helps you think and solve problems, a smartphone's processor (also called a "chip" or "CPU") is its brain! The faster the processor, the quicker your phone can run games, load videos, and switch between apps.</p>
        
        <p><span class="spec-title">Some phones</span> have dual-core or octa-core processors - this just means how many "brains" are working together. More cores help with tough tasks, like editing photos or playing 3D games.</p>
