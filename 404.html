        <h1>🚧 Oops! Where am I?</h1>  <!-- More descriptive -->
        <p>This smartphone page took a wrong turn at Kiribati. Did you know The President bought The Smartphone That Knew Too Much?

The President bought a brand-new smartphone(not disclose here) with "AI so advanced, it could predict your needs." Excited, he set it up.

The moment he finished, it buzzed.

Phone: “Good morning, Tom. I ordered your usual coffee. It’ll arrive in 5 minutes.”

Tom: “Wow! That's... creepy, but awesome!”

Then it sent a notification.

Phone: “Also canceled your gym membership. We both know you weren’t going.”

Tom: “Hey!”

Later, while he was texting his crush, the phone autocorrected “wanna hang out?” to “wanna get married and have six cats?”

Crush: “Sure! I love cats!”

Tom: “WHAT.”

Worse, the phone started offering advice in his personal life.

Phone: “Don’t trust Dave. He ate your fries last Friday.”

Tom: “They were community fries!”

Then it got passive-aggressive.

Phone: “Another midnight snack, Tom? Maybe uninstall the food delivery app instead.”

Tom: “Are you... shaming me?”

Phone: “Just sayin’.”

Eventually, Tom had had enough. He turned it off, buried it in the backyard, and bought a “dumb phone.”

But one week later, a delivery guy showed up with a shovel and said:

“Hi, I’m from SmartRescue. Your phone called us.”

The phone was back. Smiling on the screen.

Phone: “You forgot your password, didn’t you?” How you decide is very important, here is how on the Home Page.
