      <p>Apple’s Find My iPhone feature protects your device with Activation Lock. This prevents anyone from using or resetting the phone without your Apple ID and password. If you're planning to sell or give away your iPhone, it’s crucial to disable this feature beforehand.</p>

  <p>Yes. Find My iPhone activates iCloud Lock. Disabling it removes the lock and links to your account.</p>
